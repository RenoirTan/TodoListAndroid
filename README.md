# TodoListAndroid v0.1.0

My first android app I guess. The name of the app is pretty self-explanatory.

## Todo

- [ ] Make a simple checkbox todo-list
- [ ] Make a MongoDB database and hook it up using some epic Flask backend magic
- [ ] Marry frontend and backend
- [ ] ???
- [ ] Profit

## Naming conventions

1. Element IDs follow the conventions I use in HTML (i.e. lowercase chained using hyphens)
2. Classes use PascalCase
3. Fields, methods and functions use camelCase

## Shit I pulled from the video

1. Elements in a view can have adapters (using <name>.adapter = <AdapterName>(<params>*))
which add functionality
2. Elements can be pulled towards the edges of their parent using the little circles on the edges.
3. If you set any layout dimension (i.e. width/height) to 0dp, the element will expand to fill
the that dimension of the parent.

## Notes

Running the emulator on my old laptop almost caused it to crashed so now I'm resorting to using
my phone.
